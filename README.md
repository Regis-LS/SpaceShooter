# SpaceShooter
  A basic and simple SpaceShooter project made by github.com/Regis-LS.
  To run the project you just need to enter the SpaceShooter file from the repository, install it and open it with gamemaker, feel free to open the project and analyze the code (the comments are in portuguese, in the next projects I will do them in english).
